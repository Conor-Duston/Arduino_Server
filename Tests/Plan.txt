Tests needed:

Server needs:
- Get - retreive correct files
- Put - Insertes correct file, then Get works
- Delete - Removes only user files, not get files

- Chunking - Need to be able to handle files in small chunks due to memory constraints
- Rejection - Need to reject headers with bodies above a certain size

- API: Needs to get user files only

Validation:
- Overly long headers ignored
- Modifying or removing files needed for server does not work
- Server will not accept uris that are too long, and URIS that are to long will not lead to unprecitable behavior


Client needs:
- Adding and removing file from server works
